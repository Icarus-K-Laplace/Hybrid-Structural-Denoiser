# Hybrid-Structural-Denoiser
Hybrid-Structural-Denoiser: A two-stage framework for high-density impulse noise removal. It decouples robustness from geometry by first applying adaptive statistical filtering to remove outliers, then using structure tensors to guide directional refinement, restoring clean edges without deep learning.
